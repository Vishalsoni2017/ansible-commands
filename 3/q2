Create your ansible vault pwd

Ans: ansible-vault create vault.yaml
    ansible-vault view vault.yaml
    ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass vault_variables.yaml

    If we were using tower, we'd store credentials securely in there and it wouldn't matter. But, as it is we have an option to keep a password file. We can use that to decrypt the vault.

echo <your password> > .passfile
Make sure it's readable only by your user.

chmod 400 .passfile
Run the ansible playbook and consume that password file to decrypt the vault

ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=.passfile vault_variables.yaml
